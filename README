ORIGINAL README

Trip on the Funny Boat
----------------------
http://funnyboat.sourceforge.net/

This game was made for the second PyWeek competition during the week from 25.3.2006 to 2.4.2006. All source code and data was created from scratch by the project team during this time, apart from the font and the collision detection library used in the game (detailed below in "License").
Trip on the Funny Boat won the team category in PyWeek 2 and got the overall best ratings for Production (graphics and sound). This release was made shortly after the competition with a few trivial fixes made.

You play the role of a steamboat captain on the wild seas populated by sharks, pirates, minefields and the occasional seagull.

Controls:
---------

Left cursor key  / Joystick or gamepad left:      Move left
Right cursor key / Joystick or gamepad right:     Move right
Up cursor key    / Joystick or gamepad button #1: Jump
Space bar        / Joystick or gamepad button #2: Shoot with cannon

S key            / Joystick or gamepad button #6: Save screenshot as sshot.tga (NOTE: This overwrites the file so you can't take several screenshots in one session.)
P key            / Joystick or gamepad button #9: Pause the game.

Game modes:
-----------

Story mode: In the story mode, you will go through five different phases of play, and then face the final boss in the sixth phase. The story mode starts easy, but you should find it quite challenging in the last phases.
Endless mode: Endless mode will put you up against waves after waves of enemies, with twelve different phases. Endless mode is very challenging, but it's the only way to get the big high scores. :-)

Power ups:
----------

There are little health power ups that give you one heart back if you have lost them while battling enemies. You have a total of five hearts and if you lose all of them, you will die, so be sure to take all the power ups that come your way.

Enemies:
--------

Shark: The sharks jump out of the water, so you'll have to time your shooting carefully.
Mine: The mines won't try any tricks on you, but make sure that you're on a high wave or jumping when it comes your way.
Pirate ship: These bastards shoot you with their cannons. You'll have to shoot them back twice before they sink. Touching them doesn't hurt you so you might be able to sail through them if you watch their cannon fire carefully.
